## Overview
![demo_detection](/assets/d1.jpg)

[PixEye](https://pixeye.dev) is an advanced object detection system designed to process video inputs and identify objects and their subobjects in real-time. It leverages the YOLOv5 model for detection and provides functionalities to save detection results and subobject images, calculate Intersection over Union (IoU), and manage video processing efficiently.

- Real-time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv5 for detecting objects in video frames.
- Subobject Detection: Identifies subobjects within detected objects using a predefined mapping.
- JSON Output: Saves detection results in JSON format for further analysis.
- Image Saving: Crops and saves images of detected subobjects.
- FPS Calculation: Calculates and displays frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.
- Video Source Flexibility: Supports both webcam and video file inputs.
